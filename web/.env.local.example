# Next.js frontend environment variables
# Copy this file to `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase project values.

# Public Supabase URL (Project Settings -> API)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project-id.supabase.co"

# Public (anon) key (Project Settings -> API)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"

# Notes:
# - The app gates live fetching based on these env vars. If they are missing,
#   some components render in a disabled state unless `enabled={true}` is passed explicitly (mainly in tests).
# - Only use the anon key in the frontend. Keep the service role key strictly on the server.
