# Next.js frontend environment variables
# Copy this file to `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase project values.

# Notes:
# - The app gates live fetching based on these env vars. If they are missing,
#   some components render in a disabled state unless `enabled={true}` is passed explicitly (mainly in tests).
# - Only use the anon key in the frontend. Keep the service role key strictly on the server.

# Optional: Admin token for POST /api/companies/[slug]/enrich (server-only)
# If set, requests must send header: `x-admin-token: $ENRICH_ADMIN_TOKEN`

# Dev-only: enable local Python enrichment runner from the Next.js API route
# When true, POST /api/companies/[slug]/enrich will spawn `python -m pipeline.enrich_company --slug <slug>`
# Requires pipeline/.env and Python deps installed (see pipeline/README.md)
ENRICH_RUNNER_ENABLED="false"

# Optional: override Python executable and working directory for the runner
# Default python is `python`; default CWD resolves to repo root (one level above web/)
